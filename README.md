# Spacebar
## Manage yabai spaces from the menubar

Lists all spaces in the menubar and allows switching between them.
Allows windows to be moved to another space, by focusing the window and then pressing `cmd` + `left click` on the space in the list.

Inspired by the amazing [Stackline](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline). I didn't know any lua when creating this, so I simply used the Stackline Repo as a Template and removed everything I didn't need.
